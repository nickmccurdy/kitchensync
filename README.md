# Kitchen Sync
An aggregated package manager for installing packages globally.

This is currently a prototype implemented as a bash script. I might port it to another scripting language for better Windows support.

## Testing
1. Make sure you're using a Unix/Linux system with Python installed.
2. Install cram with `pip install cram` or `easy_install cram`.
3. Run `cram kitchen.t`.
